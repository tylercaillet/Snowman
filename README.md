## Board Game Overview

### **_Description_**

#### That's a total of ten mistakes. When you play Snowman, for the first incorrect answer the lower (and biggest) snowball is drawn, for the second the middle snowball is added, and for the third a snowball is added at the top (the head of the snowman). After that, the snowman gets two sticks (the arms), a top hat (like the one Frosty the Snowman wears), two eyes, and a sad face. Boom! TEN mistakes!

### **_Future Updates_**

- Be a new repo. Create a new repo in your GitHub and build your project there. DO NOT name your repository Project 1. Give it a real name.
- Include a beautiful, professional README.md (use markdown)
- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- Include a minimum of 2 HTML pages and navigation between them
- Include a minimum of 2 event handlers
- Have at least 20 meaningful git commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments, if in your code at all, should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
- Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)
- Use camelCase for JavaScript variables
- Be deployed on Surge (We will cover this on Monday of project week)
